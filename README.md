# DevOps Apprenticeship: Project Exercise

## System Requirements

The project uses poetry for Python to create an isolated environment and manage package dependencies. To prepare your system, ensure you have an official distribution of Python version 3.7+ and install poetry using one of the following commands (as instructed by the [poetry documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#system-requirements)):

### Poetry installation (Bash)

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python
```

### Poetry installation (PowerShell)

```powershell
(Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py -UseBasicParsing).Content | python
```

## Dependencies

The project uses a virtual environment to isolate package dependencies. To create the virtual environment and install required packages, run the following from your preferred shell:

```bash
$ poetry install
```

You'll also need to clone a new `.env` file from the `.env.tempalate` to store local configuration options. This is a one-time operation on first setup:

```bash
$ cp .env.template .env  # (first time only)
```

The `.env` file is used by flask to set environment variables when running `flask run`. This enables things like development mode (which also enables features like hot reloading when you make a file change). There's also a [SECRET_KEY](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/config/#SECRET_KEY) variable which is used to encrypt the flask session cookie.

## Running the App

Once the all dependencies have been installed, start the Flask app in development mode within the poetry environment by running:
```bash
$ poetry run flask run
```

You should see output similar to the following:
```bash
 * Serving Flask app "app" (lazy loading)
 * Environment: development
 * Debug mode: on
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
 * Restarting with fsevents reloader
 * Debugger is active!
 * Debugger PIN: 226-556-590
```
Now visit [`http://localhost:5000/`](http://localhost:5000/) in your web browser to view the app.

There is also a Vagrant option. With vagrant installed, and Windows Hyper-V disabled, run `vagrant up` from the root of this directory. It should do all of the above for you, and after a few minutes the app will be running on `http://localhost:5000/`.

## Secrets

Secrets (a trello API key and Token) are stored in a secrets.py file, and not checked in to git.  These look like 
```bash
TRELLO_KEY = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
TRELLO_TOKEN = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

## Constants and environment variables
`constants.py` has some constants in - these all get set automatically. When running for the first time, you will need to create a new trello board, and set the environemnt variable "TRELLO_BOARD_ID" to the id of the new board. 
The environment variable "DONT_CHECK_FOR_TRELLO_LIST_IDS" is for testing, and should be set to false when running the app.

## Testing

Unit, integration and end-to-end tests using pytest are available - run then in your favourite IDE. 
End to end tests will require:
 * internet connectivity
